# Building Segmentation Using Remote Sensing and OpenStreetMap

This repository contains the code and data for my work on Instance Segmentation.


It includes:
- Source code for instance segmentation built on FPN and ResNet101.
- Data pre-processing code for handling noise in dataset.
- Training code for a dummy data.
- Jupyter notebooks to visualize the detection pipeline at every step.
- Example of results on our own dataset.

## Source Code

The source code implemented in this study is available in the [MaskRCNN](MaskRCNN) folder.

## Data

The data used in this study are remote sensing OpenSteetMap, a dummy data available in the [Data](Data) folder. 


## Results

You can find the results of this project in the [Results](Results) folder.
